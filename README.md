# compensation-analytics-merit-planning
Data-driven compensation analysis including market benchmarking, pay equity review, and merit increase modeling.

📬 About This Project
 
 This case study illustrates how people analytics can support compensation strategy by integrating market benchmarking, pay equity review, and merit planning.

 📊 Project Objective

To simulate a merit cycle that:

* assesses compensation competitiveness relative to market benchmarks

* identifies potential pay equity risks

* allocates merit increases based on performance and market position

* maintains budget discipline while improving pay alignment

🧭 Business Context

Organizations must balance attracting and retaining talent with maintaining internal equity and fiscal responsibility. This case study models how data-driven compensation planning can support these goals.

🔍 Key Questions Addressed

* Are employees paid competitively relative to the market?

* Are there potential pay equity risks within similar roles?

* How can merit increases be allocated fairly and strategically?

* Can compensation improvements be achieved within a fixed budget?

🗂 Dataset

A simulated employee dataset including:

* job titles and levels

* base salaries

* performance ratings

* gender

* tenure and experience

⚙️ Methodology
Job Architecture & Benchmarking

* Aliged internal roles to external occupational benchmarks

* Structured job levels to reflect scope and responsibility

* Used percentile market data (P25, median, P75) to anchor pay ranges

Market Competitiveness Analysis

* Compa-ratio (salary vs. market midpoint)

* Range penetration

* Market position flags (below / at / above market)

Pay Equity Review

* Compared pay within similarly situated roles

* Evaluated average pay and market positioning differences

Budget Governance

* Applied a merit budget equal to 3% of total payroll

* Monitored total spend and variance

* Ensured fiscal compliance

📈 Impact Summary
Market Alignment

* Reduced employees positioned below market

* Improved overall compa-ratio alignment
